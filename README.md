The AI-powered mental health chatbot is designed to support users dealing with emotional distress or mental health challenges. However, during testing, it was observed that the chatbot occasionally provides responses that are generic, dismissive, or inappropriate, especially when users express signs of vulnerability or crisis. This behavior poses serious ethical, emotional, and legal concerns, as it can potentially worsen a user's mental state and erode trust in the platform. To address this, white box testing is being conducted to ensure the chatbot's internal logic handles sensitive scenarios with empathy, safety, and compliance, including appropriate escalation to human support when needed.
